1. Every space three vector must be normalized
2. Ray direction must be normalized
3. In tangent space, the direction of incident ray and exitant ray must 
  point to the same side with normal when bxdf is reflect or the opposite
  side with normal if transmission
4. In tangent space, (x, y, z)->(tangent, btangent, normal)
5. Rotation and scale are both related to the world origin
6. Btangent = cross(tangent, normal)
7. In Custom Primitive, tangent is along the u
